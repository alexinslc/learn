# Getting started with hackUSU
We're glad you're here and are interested in being a part of hackUSU. While attending the
hackUSU events is always awesome, sometimes there's just not enough time to cover the basics
for new members of hackUSU. We've created this guide to help bridge this gap that can sometimes happen.

## hackUSU Basics
During hackUSU we use various software and tools to get stuff done. To get started, you'll want to have some
basic understanding of these types of tools. Let's go over some basic terminology.

1. **Laptop** - You'll need one of these. For most of the projects we work on at hackUSU, you won't need anything super fast, almost any laptop should work if it's been created within the last 5 years.
2. **Editor** - An editor or text-editor is used for typing up your code. You'll want a good editor you feel comfortable with. We like [Atom.io], [Sublime Text], or [Notepad ++]. There are many others but you'll have to find which works best for you.
3. **Shell** - The shell is usually a console window on whatever operating system you're using. The shell is used to type commands to the computer. This is also referred to as the **command line interface** or **CLI**. There are various types of "shells" you may use. The most common are BASH on Mac or Linux and Powershell is typically used on Windows.  On Windows you can also install Git Bash or Cygwin to have a similar experience to BASH on Mac and Linux.
4. **Version Control** - We use [version control] on all of our projects. Why? When you have many changes happening in a team, it's important to know who changed what and when they changed it. We use [Git] exclusively. Learn more about [Git] and version control by watching [these videos].
5. **Programming Languages** - Whether you know one or not, you'll want to familarize yourself with a couple. Starting out with something simple like [HTML], [Python], or [Ruby] is a great idea. If you don't know these, don't worry. We'll be providing great resources to get you up-to-speed in no time!


That's pretty much it, read over these basics and do some small research on what is available to you. We'll be updating this list as time goes on. Feel free to add more yourself.
